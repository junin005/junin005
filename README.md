💻 Developer in Training
Currently studying Systems Analysis and Development, diving into the vast world of programming. I’m still figuring out which area I want to specialize in, but Web and Game Development are definitely catching my eye (even though I haven’t explored them much yet).

📈 Seeking Experience
More than anything, I’m focused on gaining experience, both in the programming field and in life. If a job comes along where I can learn and grow, I’m all in! Remote work would be a dream, but I’m open to relocating if needed.

👨‍💻 Skills

Intermediate Python
Basic knowledge of C
Always eager to learn new languages and technologies
💡 "Experience is worth more than gold... but if I can have both, even better!"
